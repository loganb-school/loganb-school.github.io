<p>The respiratory system allows us to breathe, letting oxygen in and expelling carbon dioxide, a byproduct of our cells doing their jobs.</p>

<p>The respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, windpipe, and lungs. </p>
<p>Air enters the respiratory system through the nose or the mouth, tiny hairs called cilia protect the nasal passageways and other parts of the respiratory tract, filtering out dust and other particles that enter the nose through the breathed air.</p>
<p>The lungs and respiratory system allow oxygen in the air to be taken into the body, while also letting the body get rid of carbon dioxide in the air breathed out. Carbon dioxide, made by the cells as they do their work, moves out of the cells into capillaries, where most of it dissolves in the plasma of the blood and the rest is exhaled.</p>
